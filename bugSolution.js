```javascript
/*Solution 1: Setting a fixed width on the parent*/
<div class="flex w-full">
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-1/2"></div>
</div>

/*Solution 2: Using basis to define width (preferred for more dynamic layouts)*/
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 basis-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 basis-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
The first solution sets the parent's width to `w-full`, ensuring that the `w-1/2` class is applied to the full available width of the parent container. The second solution uses `basis-1/2` which offers more flexibility and control in different layouts, explicitly setting the width for the children of the flex container.
