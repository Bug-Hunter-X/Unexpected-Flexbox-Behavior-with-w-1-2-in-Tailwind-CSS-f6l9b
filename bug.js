```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet intends to create two equally sized divs that occupy the full width of their parent container using Tailwind CSS's `w-1/2` class. However, it will not work as expected due to default `flex` behavior.  The `flex` container's children will try to occupy available space resulting in unexpected layout in some cases.
